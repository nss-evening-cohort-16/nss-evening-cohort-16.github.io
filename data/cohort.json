Before beginning my journey at Nashville Software School in web development, I was working as a Distance Learning Technician for the University of Mississippi. This role allowed me to bridge the gap between my love of learning in higher education and technology. These industries are as intertwined as ever with the global pandemic, and this past year has allowed us to adapt to and grow with the challenges presented to distance learning and remote work. I was introduced to web development a few years ago and have realized that I can push myself even further to actually create and work on the projects that are so needed today, instead of just implementing them in my current role. I am very detail-oriented and love getting a large problem to solve. Developing web applications allows me to be creative with solving these problems and making significant decisions, and I love every minute of it. Recently, I joined the Interactive Development team at GS&F in Nashville! Personally, I like to read, tend to my ever-growing collection of plants, spend time with my family, and see live music with my partner. I'm also a yoga teacher, coffee-drinker, and mama to the best five-year-old :)",

After the Air Force I became a Machine Builder in the automation field. There I used my technical skills to help fabricate and build automated assembly technology for several different industries. As I looked to expand my skills and education, I became interested in software development due to its problem-solving nature, and compatibility with the knowledge and mindset gained in my previous work. When I started learning to code, I became entranced with what seemed like an near infinite set of tools to solve almost any problem. I then wanted to expand my new found passion into my profession.",
